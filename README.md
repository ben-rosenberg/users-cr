# USERS
If you're here hoping to see my work for the Users CR assignment, I realized that uploading it to GitHub and then using the same project/repo for the Users CRUD will make that a little difficult. To see my work for the Users CR assignment, click "3 commits" at the top-right of the table with the list of files and you should be able to see the original commit. The first commit corresponds to Users CR, and the second and third to Users CRUD.

Users CRUD Modularized will have its own repository.
